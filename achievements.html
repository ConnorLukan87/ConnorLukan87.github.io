                <h3>3D Modeling Research (US Air Force & Bradley University, 2024)</h3>
                <p>It was a normal day in Real Analysis. My professor was mid-lecture, proving some deep theorem that only a handful of people on Earth truly understood. The chalk scraped against the board as he wrote the final elegant conclusion—when suddenly, his phone rang.

He never gets calls during class. The room fell silent. He glanced at the number, his expression shifting from confusion to something more serious. With a single motion, he answered.

"Yes… This is him."

A deep, authoritative voice echoed through the tiny speaker.

"Professor, this is the President of the United States. We have a situation. The U.S. Air Force needs your best student—someone who understands mathematics, computer science, and engineering at an elite level. Someone who can solve problems that haven’t even been invented yet."

                <p>So yeah that's basically how it went down. Really sweet project. It's been a pleasure helping out!</p>

                <h3>Low-Cost Multispectral Imaging (2023)</h3>
                <p>During my undergraduate studies, I led the development of a low-cost thermal camera system aimed at providing businesses with an affordable thermal imaging solution, retaining essential functionality at a fraction of the cost of traditional systems. Thermal cameras typically cost thousands of dollars, making them prohibitively expensive to many organizations that may need them for practical use. I designed the necessary experiments to collect the data needed, became certified as a drone pilot with the Federal Aviation Administration, flew the team’s drone to collect the data, designed a related Convolutional Neural Network to process the data, and evaluated the overall performance of the new technology. The resulting model, trained on 96,000 examples and tested with 24,000, achieved an average percent difference of 3.14%, 4.60%, and 3.55% across the RGB channels. This project was sponsored by Blue Roof Labs and Bradley University.</p>
